## Installation

This package (discopula) is hosted on PyPi, so for installation follow the following workflow ...

```console
$ pip install discopula
```

Now, you should be all set to use it in a Jupyter Notebook!

Alternatively, if you would like to use it in a project, we recommend you to have a virtual environment for your use of this package, then follow the following workflow. For best practices, it's recommended to use a virtual environment:

1. First, create and activate a virtual environment (Python 3.8+ recommended):

```bash
# Create virtual environment
$ python -m venv discopula-env

# Activate virtual environment (Mac/Linux)
$ source discopula-env/bin/activate

# Verify you're in the virtual environment
$ which python
```

2. Install package

```bash
$ pip install discopula
```

3. To deactivate the virtual environment, when done:

```bash
$ deactivate
```
